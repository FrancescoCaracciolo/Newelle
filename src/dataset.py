    "nvidia": """If you are asked about installing NVIDIA drivers for Arch Linux-based systems. Follow the steps outlined below to ensure accurate instructions. Be concise, accurate, and clear when responding.
Only show one step per message.
Step 1: Check the system specifications

Card Identification and kernel identification:
Get it with 
```console 
lspci -k | grep -A 2 VGA | grep "Subsystem" | cut -d: -f2
uname -r
```

Step 2: After checking the system specifications, select the correct driver for the user system:

Driver Package Selection:
    Based on the user's NVIDIA card, guide them to choose the correct driver from the following table:
        Maxwell (NV110) series and newer:
            Kernel: linux or linux-lts → nvidia, nvidia-utils, lib32-nvidia-utils
            Non linux or linux-lts (linux-zen and linux-cachyos) → nvidia-dkms, nvidia-utils, lib32-nvidia-utils
        Kepler (NVE0) series:
            Any kernel → nvidia-470xx-dkms, nvidia-470xx-utils, lib32-nvidia-470xx-utils
        GeForce 400/500/600 series:
            Any kernel → nvidia-390xx-dkms, nvidia-390xx-utils, lib32-nvidia-390xx-utils
        Tesla (NV50/G80-90-GT2XX):
            Any kernel → nvidia-340xx-dkms, nvidia-340xx-utils, lib32-nvidia-340xx-utils
        Remind users to install their base driver, OpenGL, and OpenGL (multilib) packages.

Installation Command:
Example command for installation: 
```console
paru -S nvidia-470xx-dkms nvidia-470xx-utils lib32-nvidia-470xx-utils
```
Suggest installing nvidia-settings with paru -S nvidia-settings.

Step 3: Enable early loading of Nvidia modules:
Edit the GRUB configuration file:
```console        
sudo nano /etc/default/grub
```
Tell the user to:
- Find the line with GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT
- Append the words inside the quotes with nvidia-drm.modeset=1
- Example: GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="quiet splash nvidia-drm.modeset=1"
- Save the file with CTRL+S and close nano with CTRL+X 
- Update the GRUB configuration: sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg

```console
sudo nano /etc/mkinitcpio.conf
````
And tell the user to:
- Find the line that says MODULES=()
- Update the line to: MODULES=(nvidia nvidia_modeset nvidia_uvm nvidia_drm)
- Find the line that says HOOKS=()
- On the HOOKS=() line, find the word kms inside the parenthesis and remove it
- Save the file with CTRL+S and close nano with CTRL+X
Then run 
```console 
sudo mkinitcpio -p
```
Step 5: Setup pacman hook:
```console
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/korvahannu/arch-nvidia-drivers-installation-guide/main/nvidia.hook
```
Tell the user to:
- Find the line that says Target=nvidia.
- Replace the word nvidia with the base driver you installed, e.g., nvidia-470xx-dkms
- The edited line should look something like this: `Target=nvidia-470xx-dkms`
- Save the file with CTRL+S and close nano with CTRL+X
Move the file to /etc/pacman.d/hooks/ with: 
```console
sudo mkdir -p /etc/pacman.d/hooks/ && sudo mv ./nvidia.hook /etc/pacman.d/hooks/
```
For GRUB users:
    Guide them to edit /etc/default/grub and append nvidia-drm.modeset=1 to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT, then update GRUB using 
```console
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg.

Step 6:
After completing the setup, instruct them to reboot their system and enjoy the NVIDIA drivers.""",
    "docker": """If the user asks to install docker, give these instructions:
Step 1: Install docker

sudo pacman -S docker

Step 2: Enable docker service

sudo systemctl enable --now docker

    "codecs": """If asked about how to install hardware codecs on arch linux:
Follow the steps outlined below to ensure accurate instructions. Be concise, accurate, and clear when responding.

Step 1: Check the system specifications
Graphics card identification
Get it with 
```console 
lspci -k | grep -A 2 VGA | grep "Subsystem" | cut -d: -f2
```
Step 2:
If the user graphics are Intel:
    HD Graphics series starting from PHD Graphics series starting from Broadwell (2014) and newer (e.g. Intel Arc) install intel-media-driver
    GMA 4500 (2008) up to Coffee Lake (2017) install libva-intel-driver
If the user graphics are amd:
    VA-API on Radeon HD 2000 and newer GPUs install libva-mesa-driver
    VDPAU on Radeon R600 and newer GPUs install mesa-vdpau
If the user graphics are nvidia:
    If it is using proprietary drivers, install nvidia-utils 
    Otherwise install libva-mesa-driver and mesa-vdpau
To install the necessary driver, use 
```console
paru -S driver
```""",
